instauto is an Instagram automation/bot library written in modern, clean javascript using Google's Puppeteer. Goal is to be very easy to set up, use, and extend, and obey instagram's limits. Heavily inspired by [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), but I thought it was way too heavy and hard to setup.

**NEW! üéâ**
Now there is a GUI application for those who don't want to code: [SimpleInstaBot](https://mifi.github.io/SimpleInstaBot/)


## Setup

- First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 8 or newer.
  - On MacOS, it's recommended to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install node`

- Create a new directory with a file like [example.js](https://github.com/mifi/instauto/blob/master/example.js)

- Adjust your `example.js` to your needs. If you want to see how it would work without doing any invasive actions, use the `dryRun: true` option. Toggle `headless` to see it in action.

- Open a terminal in the directory

- Run `npm i -g yarn`

- Run `yarn add puppeteer instauto`

- Run `node example`

You can run this code for example once every day using cron or pm2 or similar

See [index.js](https://github.com/mifi/instauto/blob/master/src/index.js) for available options.

## Supported functionality

- Follow the followers of some particular users. (e.g. celebrities.) Parameters like max/min ratio for followers/following can be set.

- Unfollow users that don't follow us back. Will not unfollow any users that we recently followed.

- Unfollow auto followed users (also those following us back) after a certain number of days.

- The code automatically prevents breaching 100 follow/unfollows per hour or 700 per 24hr, to prevent bans. This can be configured.

See [example.js](https://github.com/mifi/instauto/blob/master/example.js) for example of features

## Tips
- Run this on a machine with a non-cloud IP to avoid being banned

## Troubleshooting

- If it doesn't work, make sure your instagram language is set to english

## Running on Raspberry Pi

Because puppeteer chrome binaries are not provided for RPi, you need to first install chromium using apt.

Then replace your puppeteer launch code:

```js
browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser',
    headless: true,
    args: ['--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor'],
});
```

- https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/3774

Also you might want to install the more lightweight package `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer`.

## Running with pm2
First install [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2). (`npm i -g pm2`) Then copy [instabot.yml](https://github.com/mifi/instauto/blob/master/instabot.yml) into the same dir as `example.js` and run:

```bash
pm2 start instabot.yml
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

Now it will run automatically on reboot! üôå
